                    <p>Hello There! No this isn't Obi-Wan Kenobi, as much as I wish I was. My name is Aaryan Shah. Im an avid sports fan ( RCB,Arsenal { we are beatind Madrid 4-0 aggregate you heard it here first }
                        ,GSW and ICT ).I also love cooking ( and eating :> ), drawing and music.Although, the hobby I take the most pride in annoying the life out of my younger brother.
                        I'm a CND student ( don't feel bad for me, it was my first preference ) who will definitely most probably maybe graduate in 5 years. I love Chemistry, probably a little
                        more than I should, and hopefully I'm able to produce research in the field that contributes the world postively.
